## Bamazon app (A Node application designed to communicate with and update a MySql database from the terminal)

### Customer View
### Step 1:  Calling the appropriate .js file in Node will lead to our main menu screen welcoming the user to Bamazon and then showing the entire inventory for the service including ID, Name of Product, Price, and Amount of product in inventory.  It will also ask the user what is the ID# of the item they wish to purchase.

### Step 2:  After answering the first question, the user is prompted with the second question of how many they would like to buy.

### Step 3:  After answering both questions, the application will provide a total cost for the user and also make them aware that their package has shipped.  It will then return to the main menu with the new inventory count.

##Step 4:  If the quantity requested exceeds the available inventory then a message appears to inform the user that the order cannot be filled.  It then returns the main menu.
